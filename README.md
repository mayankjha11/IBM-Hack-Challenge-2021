Objective - We present a model where we will be analysing different OTT platform data like Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+Hotstar. Our main objective is to find the main       insights from their respective dataset and compare them against each other to help the user take a predictive guess to choose the best OTT subscription as per their basis.
